            The beginning of our introductory math journey is Logic. Through
            these challenging problem solving exercises, you'll construct the
            critical thinking skills that are the basis for mathematical
            reasoning.

            You'll use limited information to make predictions â€“ eliminating the
            impossible to uncover the truth. This course builds up to some truly
            mind-bending challenges!

                By the end of this course, you'll be able to spot logical
                fallacies, navigate some strategic game theory, understand
                machine logic, and use the symbolic languages of logic to
                understand fun riddles.
